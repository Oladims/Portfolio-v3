              As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design - combining state-of-the-art  technical knowledge with a keen eye for design to create a most beautiful product and services. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging user experience.

            <strong>When I'm not coding</strong> you can find me playing video games (FIFA, PES), watching Anime, or hanging out with friends/family.
